##### A project for learning an aspect of developing a Polymer app, deployed on Firebase hosting.

The idea is to prove out an approach or component in the simplest project first, before combining it with other code in a real project.

# \<polyrest\>

## What it does:

This is a kind of database client for HATEOAS-REST, much in the vein of phpAdmin or something like that for SQL dbs.

This video of the app working will probably explains it best: https://youtu.be/ydklb9T_8Bs

If you don't know HATEOAS then it still might not make much sense to you, and perhaps something such as this might begin to explain: https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/

For more info, see the docs directory.

This was written in 2015 with Polymer 1 and a very minimal javascript skillset. Gosh only knows what you will find here.

It has never been deployed on firebase, but I keep it with my other polymer projects here in poly-on-fire, because it's part of my Polymer portfolio.
